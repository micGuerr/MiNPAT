# NODDI MATLAB toolbox download and installation

## Download
You can download the software [here](http://mig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?n=Download.NODDI).

## Insatllation
Assuming the compressed file has been downloaded in the `~/Downloads` folder, we first need to move the compressed file to the location you prefer (e.g., `~/Documents/MATLAB/`).

Type the following commands from terminal (replace the *XXX* with the actual version you downloaded):
```bash
mv  ~/Downloads/NODDI_toolbox_vXXX.zip ~/Documents/MATLAB/
```

Next, we can unzip the NODDI toolbox folder by typing:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/MATLAB/
unzip NODDI_toolbox_vXXX.zip
```

Keep track of the path to the toolbox folder (in our example `~/Documents/MATLAB/NODDI_toolbox_vXXX`).
